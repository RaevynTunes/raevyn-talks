pageTitle: Progress, Writer's Block, and Time

<p>
  If it wasn't obvious before, I'm a beginning producer. 
  At the time of this writing, I've been at it for about two years, and it's been great.
  I've definitely improved a lot, but lately I've had the dreaded problem: <b>writer's block</b>.
</p>
<p>
  To clarify, it's not like I can't come up with any ideas- it's quite the opposite, I come up with a lot of things- 
  it's just that the ideas never seem to go anywhere. It's pretty upsetting, since what I want to do is make something,
  and I'm failing to do that.
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to iterate over any of the reasons why I think my creativity is dampening itself, mainly for my own benefit,
  but you might relate to some of these.
