pageTitle: Progress, Writer's Block, and Time

<p>
  If it wasn't obvious before, I'm a beginning producer. At the time of this
  writing, I've been at it for about two years, and it's been great. I've
  definitely improved a lot, but lately I've had the dreaded problem:
  <b>writer's block</b>.
</p>
<p>
  To clarify, it's not like I can't come up with any ideas- it's quite the
  opposite, I come up with a lot of things- it's just that the ideas never seem
  to go anywhere. It's pretty upsetting, since what I want to do is make
  something, and I'm failing to do that.
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to iterate over any of the reasons why I think my creativity is
  dampening itself, mainly for my own benefit, but you might relate to some of
  these.

<h3>Limits & Anxiety</h3>
<p>
  I have an social anxiety disorder. It's actually on the paper the doctors give me every time 
  I go to the office- 'Childhood Social Anxiety Disorder' and then next to that there'd be a bunch of
  trivial things, like allergies. It makes me chuckle every time I look at it.
</p>
<p>
  The significance of this, however, is that I'm constantly thinking about how I'll be recieved by people,
  and how what I do will affect people. I think this may have bled into my music, and I started to get concerned.
</p>
<p>
  With the anxiety, I feel like I'm limiting myself, telling myself things like <i>'You don't know what you're doing'</i>, or
  <i>'I wish I could sound like X, Y or Z'</i> before actually figuring out if any of those things were true. It sucks.
</p>
<p>
  So to counteract this, I started on an EP. It may seem counterintuitive to combat anxiety over acceptance by releasing
  a larger project, but I'm going to go all out on this and not care about other people's feelings with it. It'll also be a way
  for me to express some of the feelings I've had recently, and I'm hoping it'll be good for me. There's also the possibilty that
  the whole thing will be garbage, but I'm pretty sure it won't be.
