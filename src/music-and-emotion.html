<p>
  I've listened to a lot of music over the years. My parents had the radio on
  every time we were in the car, and I realized something after a while:
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <strong>I don't like the music on the radio.</strong>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This wasn't always the case, of course- there are always exceptions- but for
  the most part, I'd dislike what the stations were playing. My dad listened to
  hip-hop and rap, and my mom listened to R&B, and I had my issues with both.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  With R&B, it was more of a taste thing. The music isn't exactly the most
  energetic and exciting, and I got bored of it pretty easily. Hip-hop and rap,
  however, was another story. I didn't really like what the songs were talking
  about- sex, drugs, and violence- and I decided to start listening to something
  else.
  <br />
  That 'something else' turned out to be electronic music.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Another thing that electronic gave me, other than a clearer head, was emotion.
  I like feeling things from songs, emotions and stories brought to my attention
  by music. Instead of just talking about myself, though, I'll start off by
  giving some examples of artists and songs that deliver.

  Paul, a.k.a modus, is an amazing artist and a great guy in general.
