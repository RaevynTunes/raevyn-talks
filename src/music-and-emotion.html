pageTitle: Music & Emotion

<p>
  I've listened to a lot of music over the years. My parents had the radio on
  every time we were in the car, and I realized something after a while:
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <strong>I don't like the music on the radio.</strong>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This wasn't always the case, of course- there are always exceptions- but for
  the most part, I'd dislike what the stations were playing. My dad listened to
  hip-hop and rap, and my mom listened to R&B, and I had my issues with both.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  With R&B, it was more of a taste thing. The music isn't exactly the most
  energetic and exciting, and I got bored of it pretty easily. Hip-hop and rap,
  however, was another story. I didn't really like what the songs were talking
  about- sex, drugs, and violence- and I decided to start listening to something
  else.
  <br />
  That 'something else' turned out to be electronic music.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Another thing that electronic gave me, other than a clearer head, was emotion.
  I like feeling things from songs, emotions and stories brought to my attention
  by music. Instead of just talking about myself, though, I'll start off by
  giving some examples of artists and songs that deliver.

  Paul, a.k.a modus, is an amazing artist and a great guy in general. His
  production is top tier for sure, and he's put out a lot of great tunes. You
  should check him and his stuff out (start with the No Limits LP and work up
  from there). The specific song I want to talk about, however, is Timeless:
  Over Me II with Sky Roses.

  For one thing: this song is bangin'. Like, an absolute chune. How did he pull it off? I don't even know.
  He does have a breakdown on his Youtube channel, so you could watch that if you want some in-depth info.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Important factor number two: It tells a story; a love story, in fact. Usually I'm not a fan, but Paul and Sky pull it off somehow.

      It's a story of an impossible love, hence the last line in the lyrics:
      'I may not be able to love you, but I still want you to stay.'
      Our love is impossible, but I still appreciate you being around.
      </i>

    <p>
      - modus, on the song's meaning

    Third: It gave me the feels. Like, emotional tension that I don't really get that often from songs. I really appreciate it.
