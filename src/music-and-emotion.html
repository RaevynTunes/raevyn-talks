pageTitle: Music & Emotion
---

<p>
  I've listened to a lot of music over the years. My parents had the radio on
  every time we were in the car, and I realized something after a while:
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <strong>I don't like the music on the radio.</strong>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  This wasn't always the case, of course- there are always exceptions- but for
  the most part, I'd dislike what the stations were playing. My dad listened to
  hip-hop and rap, and my mom listened to R&B, and I had my issues with both.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  With R&B, it was more of a taste thing. The music isn't exactly the most
  energetic and exciting, and I got bored of it pretty easily. Hip-hop and rap,
  however, was another story. I didn't really like what the songs were talking
  about- sex, drugs, and violence- and I decided to start listening to something
  else.
  <br />
  That 'something else' turned out to be electronic music.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Another thing that electronic gave me, other than a clearer head, was emotion.
  I like feeling things from songs, emotions and stories brought to my attention
  by music. Instead of just talking about myself, though, I'll start off by
  giving some examples of artists and songs that deliver.

  <h3>modus</h3>
  <p>
    Paul, a.k.a modus, is an amazing artist and a great guy in general. His
    production is top tier for sure, and he's put out a lot of great tunes. You
    should check him and his stuff out (start with the No Limits LP and work up
    from there). The specific song I want to talk about, however, is Timeless:
    Over Me II with Sky Roses.

    For one thing: this song is bangin'. Like, an absolute chune. How did he pull it off? I don't even know.
    He does have a breakdown on his Youtube channel, so you could watch that if you want some in-depth info.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Important factor number two: It tells a story; a love story, in fact. Usually I'm not a fan, but Paul and Sky pull
    it
    off somehow.

        It's a story of an impossible love, hence the last line in the lyrics:
        'I may not be able to love you, but I still want you to stay.'
        Our love is impossible, but I still appreciate you being around.

  <h3>
    Skybreak
  </h3>
  <p>
    Skybreak is cracked. I'm not even joking, dude's a legend. Fusing melodicity and emotion into his tunes
    with grace and ease.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I was going to showcase the song below as an example, right, but then a new tune came out the day I was writing
    this,
    and it blew this one out of the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    The song I'm actually showcasing is called Cryolite.

  <p>
    I was actually speechless when the song ended. The nostalgic vibe, the vocals (god, the vocals), and the overall
    atmosphere
    from that song, and the whole EP honestly, is what pushes this one over the top. A excellent tune and an amazing EP.

  <h3>
    Pixel Terror
  </h3>
  <p>
    Pixel Terror's story is intresting. Originally starting out as a duo, they recently split (on a positive note,
    luckily),
    and Bentley took over the main name, while Ahrya became Afinity. I actually have two songs from when they were a duo
    to
    show off: Bittersweet and Collapse.

  <p>
    I picked these two because they kind of contrast. Bittersweet has a tense intro (that lead, sheesh) and goes into a
    heavy drop. An absolute classic. Collapse, on the other hand, is melodic throughout. It's still just as good, and
    there are some pretty nice vocals, courtesy of neverwaves. Two solid tunes.

<h3>
  What It's For
</h3>
<p>
  I feel like these songs illustrate emotion in the best way I could show you. However, you might be asking what this is
  all for. Why did I show you these? It's simple- I'm a producer, and I want to capture emotion like these songs do. I
  want the emotion to flow out of my music in the way these songs do. I want people to connect, and to feel something
  when they here my latest tunes. I think these artists can do it, and I want to as well.
</p>

<p>
  Maybe you're an aspiring producer as well- who knows?- but I want to make it clear that emotion is an amazing
  thing to put into song form. Not every tune has to just be a heavy headbanging one.
</p>
<p>
  That's all from me, though. If you didn't skip the rest of the song, then thanks for reading. If you did skip, that's
  okay
  too, we all have different attention spans. Have a nice day.
  - Lost Love

    Bonus: Honourable Mentions
  </h3>
  <p>
    The title 'Honourable Mentions' is a bit misleading here. This is just basically a dump of songs that I enjoy in the
    same
    way I enjoy these tunes.
